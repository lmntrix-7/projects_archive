# Chopsticks Game Bot with Alpha-Beta Cutoff Search

Overview: Developed a bot to play the game of Chopsticks, utilizing an Alpha-Beta (AB) cutoff search algorithm to efficiently evaluate moves and optimize decision-making.

Objective: Design an intelligent bot that can navigate the game state of Chopsticks, applying Alpha-Beta pruning with a depth cutoff to improve response time and gameplay strategy.

Key Features:
  1. Alpha-Beta Cutoff Search: Implemented Alpha-Beta pruning with a depth cutoff to enhance search efficiency, allowing the bot to focus on the most promising moves without exhaustively searching all possibilities.
  2. Game Strategy: The bot assesses possible moves and anticipates opponent actions, making choices aimed at securing a win.

Key Technologies:
 1. Python
 2. Alpha-Beta pruning with depth cutoff for optimized search in game trees

Outcome: Created a competitive Chopsticks bot capable of strategic play, balancing depth of analysis with computation speed through Alpha-Beta cutoff search.
