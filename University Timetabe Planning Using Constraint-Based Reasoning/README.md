# University Timetable Planning Using Constraint-Based Reasoning

Overview: Addressed university timetabling as a constraint satisfaction problem, balancing scheduling constraints and optimization.

Objective: Create efficient timetables using advanced constraint-solving techniques that minimize conflicts and maximize resource usage.

Key Technologies:
  1. Constraint propagation
  2. Backtracking and simulated annealing
  3. Google OR-Tools CP Solver

Outcome: Developed an optimal timetable solution that balanced efficiency with flexibility, establishing a foundation for further hybrid and optimization-based scheduling models.
